It is the far far in the future, The Combine have long since been pushed off Earth and Humanity has spread across the stars, discovering new planets, species and materials. Gordan Freeman is a legend passed on generation to generation. 

You select your race
A shop keeper talks to you, lends you money, discusses the common roles that people do.
	> Pirate - Steal Ships and their precious materials, Rob the (AI) shopkeeper, 
	> Miner - Searches the galaxy for rare materials found on distant planets and asteroids. 
	> Transporter - Transports goods from planet to planet, selling the goods from one shop keeper to another 
	> Colonisation - Colonises the classically uninhabitable planets, establishing new bases for your race\faction. But be careful of pirates. You will have to deal with transporters to get materials to your planet to attract shopkeepers
	> "Police\Bounty Hunter" - There are no real interglatic police as the three races fight about everything - this has allowed pirates to roam free, harrassing everybody. 
	> Shopkeepers - Compete with the AI Shopkeeper, selling materials to players and eventually, should you rise high enough, hire the AI shopkeepers.
These roles are not assigned and the players could come up with their own ideas 
	
Like DayZ there is a noteriaty system, as the pirates rob and kill people they attract the attention of angry merchants and other players. These other players can place bounties on the pirates( limited for anti-spam ). 
Crews are formed, equivalent of teams and thats the noteriaty system

 +Planned core features:
 +
 +-Environment system including temperature and atmosphere.
 +  Player will suffer adverse affects outside. Some machines like pumps and compressors will produce differently depending on environment.
 +
 +-Resource container system
 +  Containers will hold resources
 +  Ship may behave as a singular container, possibly connected to other 'welded' containers.
 +  Pumps or mechanisms to transfer resources between containers.
 +  Method to connect containers together, ideally by welding.
 +  
 +-Resource sources: asteroids, mining things, pumps, compressors, other machines
 +  Particular areas in the environment (possibly random) where machines work better/differently/at all
 +
 +-Resource sinks: costs to 'spawn' items.
 +
 +-Combat system including health of entities and damaging weapons
 +
 +-Cooperative and competitive objectives
 +  Escape from a dying planet
 +  Fight other player teams or factions
 +  Defend against invading alien force
 +  Protect planet from meteor/asteroid impact
 +  Technology/Resource FFA race, be the richest man in the universe
 +  
 +-Tiered progression
 +  Get better machines, research more complicated technologies, outsmart your opponents with superior firepower.
 +  
 +-Ships, Building, Gmod fun
 +
 +-Large world
 +  Custom gravity to planets
